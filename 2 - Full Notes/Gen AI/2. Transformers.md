## Notes :

###### Transformer Architecture

![[Pasted image 20251009164156.png]]

The model is primarily composed of two blocks:

- **Encoder (left)**: The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.
- **Decoder (right)**: The decoder uses the encoderâ€™s representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimised for generating outputs.

###### Choosing the right architecture

|Task|Suggested Architecture|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Text classification (sentiment, topic)|Encoder|BERT, RoBERTa|
|Text generation (creative writing)|Decoder|GPT, LLaMA|
|Translation|Encoder-Decoder|T5, BART|
|Summarization|Encoder-Decoder|BART, T5|
|Named entity recognition|Encoder|BERT, RoBERTa|
|Question answering (extractive)|Encoder|BERT, RoBERTa|
|Question answering (generative)|Encoder-Decoder or Decoder|T5, GPT|
|Conversational AI|Decoder|GPT, LLaMA|
###### Pipeline

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

1. The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
2. The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
3. The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.
###### Available pipelines for different modalities

###### Text pipelines

- `text-generation`: Generate text from a prompt
- `text-classification`: Classify text into predefined categories
- `summarization`: Create a shorter version of a text while preserving key information
- `translation`: Translate text from one language to another
- `zero-shot-classification`: Classify text without prior training on specific labels
- `feature-extraction`: Extract vector representations of text

###### Image pipelines

- `image-to-text`: Generate text descriptions of images
- `image-classification`: Identify objects in an image
- `object-detection`: Locate and identify objects in images

###### Audio pipelines

- `automatic-speech-recognition`: Convert speech to text
- `audio-classification`: Classify audio into categories
- `text-to-speech`: Convert text to spoken audio

###### Multi modal pipelines

- `image-text-to-text`: Respond to an image based on a text prompt
