## Notes :

- What is NLP :
	NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.

LLMs are characterised by:

- **Scale**: They contain millions, billions, or even hundreds of billions of parameters
- **General capabilities**: They can perform multiple tasks without task-specific training
- **In-context learning**: They can learn from examples provided in the prompt
- **Emergent abilities**: As these models grow in size, they demonstrate capabilities that werenâ€™t explicitly programmed or anticipated
