## Approach

- Store all the array elements in a hashset.
- we can loop the hashset next and  we check if the set doesn't contain num - 1 we consider it as a starting of a new sequence.
- then increment the sequence length until our set contains (current number) + 1 -> in the set.
- count the longest such sequence and return it.

## Code (Java)

```java
public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {

	Set<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
	
	for(int num : nums) hs.add(num);
	
	int maxLen = 0;
	
	for(int num : hs)
	
	{
	
		if(!hs.contains(num-1))
		
		{
		
			int len = 1;
			
			while(hs.contains(num+len)) len++;
			
			maxLen = Math.max(maxLen,len);
		
		}
	
	}
	
	return maxLen;

}

```
