## Approach

- calculate the carry by doing (a & b) then left shift to add with the main sum.
- for main sum we calculate by (a ^ b).
- when the carry is zero , we have the sum.

## Code (Java)

```java
public int getSum(int a, int b) {

	while(b!=0)
	{
		int carry = (a & b) << 1;
		a = a ^ b;
		b = carry;
	}
	return a;
}

```
