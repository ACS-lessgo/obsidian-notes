## Notes :

- **B+ Tree** is a balanced tree used primarily in databases and file systems for efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
- All **records (data entries)** are stored in the **leaf nodes**; internal nodes only store keys and act as guides.
- Leaf nodes are **linked** for fast range queries.

#### Insertion Process:

1. **Search for the correct leaf** node where the new key should go.
2. **Insert the key** into the leaf node in sorted order.
3. If the leaf node **overflows** (exceeds the max number of allowed keys):
   - **Split the leaf** into two nodes.
   - Push up the **smallest key** from the new right node to the parent (internal) node.
4. If the parent node also overflows, **repeat the split process recursively** up the tree.
5. If the root overflows, create a **new root** and increase the treeâ€™s height.

#### Key Points:
- Only **leaf nodes** contain actual data.
- Insertion may cause **cascading splits** all the way to the root.
- B+ Tree maintains **sorted order** and **balance**.

#### Visual Representation :

- Array : 0005, 0009, 0011, 0013, 0016
- B+ tree ( Always sorted)
