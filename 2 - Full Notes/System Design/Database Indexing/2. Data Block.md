## Notes :

- [Data block] is the min amount of data which can be read/write by and I/O operation.
- It is managed by a storage system (Disk) . [Data block] size can range from 4 kb to 32 kb.
- DBMS maintains mapping of [Data page] and [Data block].

- ==Note== : DBMS controls Data pages (can decide which row goes in which page) but has no control on data blocks (data blocks are scattered over the disk)
